## Reconciled Items

1. Nothing Block escape mechanism (swipe-up + PIN)

   - Status: Resolved
   - Evidence: `app/(tabs)/focus.tsx` implements a `PanGestureHandler` with `handleStateChange` that shows a PIN dialog when swiped up (`if (swipePosition <= -80) { setShowPinDialog(true) }`) and `handlePinSubmit` validates the PIN against `AsyncStorage`.

2. Notification silencing during focus sessions

   - Status: Resolved
   - Evidence: `app/(tabs)/focus.tsx` defines `silenceNotifications()` and `restoreNotifications()` and calls them when sessions start/stop; `baby-lock.tsx` contains similar logic for Baby Mode.

3. Baby Lock: disable device navigation buttons

   - Status: Partially Resolved
   - Evidence: `app/(tabs)/baby-lock.tsx` calls `NavigationBar.setVisibilityAsync('hidden')` on Android and adds a `BackHandler` to block back press. iOS full device button disabling is not possible from JS; document limitation and consider native module.

4. Parental unlock PIN security

   - Status: Partially Resolved
   - Evidence: PIN flow exists in `baby-lock.tsx` and `focus.tsx` (PIN stored in `AsyncStorage`, configurable), but some UX/security hardening is missing (no brute-force protection beyond basic tap counters, default PIN fallback '1234' handling). Recommend rate-limiting or stronger validation.

5. Premium feature gating

   - Status: Resolved
   - Evidence: `hooks/useSubscription.ts` provides `isPremium` and `setPremiumStatus`. Components (`CalmingSounds.tsx`, `doodle.tsx`, `baby-lock.tsx`, `ParentalDashboard.tsx`, `baby-doodle.tsx`) check `isPremium` and show `PremiumModal` where appropriate.

6. Wellness Insights dashboard

   - Status: Partially Resolved
   - Evidence: `app/(tabs)/focus.tsx` contains `renderInsights` showing recent sessions stored in component state; there is no dedicated persistent dashboard screen or long-term storage beyond in-memory/session storage.

7. Calming Sounds (Baby Mode)

   - Status: Partially Resolved
   - Evidence: UI implemented in `components/CalmingSounds.tsx` and wired into `baby-lock.tsx`. Actual audio playback is stubbed (no sound assets or audio playback engine like `expo-av`) — gating and UI are present.

8. Parental Dashboard (reports & max duration setting)

   - Status: Partially Resolved
   - Evidence: `components/ParentalDashboard.tsx` reads `babySessionHistory` from `AsyncStorage` and displays basic stats. Missing features: export, configurable max session duration, and admin controls.

9. Nothing Block faint timer (visible only on tap)

   - Status: Resolved
   - Evidence: `app/(tabs)/focus.tsx` uses `Animated.Value` (`timerOpacity`) initialized at 0.3, `showTimer()` animates to 1 on tap and fades back after a timeout.

10. Scheduler notifications for upcoming sessions

    - Status: Unresolved
    - Evidence: `app/(tabs)/schedule.tsx` contains a UI to add sessions (in-memory) but no integration with `expo-notifications` scheduling APIs to schedule local notifications.

11. Custom time input for Nothing Block

    - Status: Unresolved
    - Evidence: `app/(tabs)/focus.tsx` has a `customDuration` state but the UI input is not present and not wired to set `selectedDuration`.

12. Ambient audio during focus sessions

    - Status: Unresolved
    - Evidence: No implementation found in `focus.tsx` for ambient audio or playback (no `expo-av` usage). `CalmingSounds` exists for Baby Mode but not for Adult focus sessions.

13. Save/export doodles (premium)

    - Status: Unresolved
    - Evidence: `app/(tabs)/doodle.tsx` has a premium `Save` button placeholder with a `/* TODO: implement save/export */` comment; `DrawingCanvas.tsx` captures strokes but no serialization/export logic exists.

14. Max session duration setting (Parental)
    - Status: Unresolved
    - Evidence: `ParentalDashboard.tsx` shows stats but there is no setting exposed to configure or enforce maximum session duration in `baby-lock.tsx`.

## Next Steps (recommended priorities)

1. Highest priority unresolved: Implement doodle save/export (item 13)

   - Reason: Premium revenue feature; straightforward to implement by serializing strokes to SVG or PNG and using `expo-file-system` + `MediaLibrary` to save/export. Low risk, high value.

2. Scheduler notifications (item 10)

   - Reason: Scheduler UI exists; scheduling local notifications with `expo-notifications` is a focused task and improves core UX.

3. Custom time input for Nothing Block (item 11)

   - Reason: Small UX improvement; `focus.tsx` already holds `customDuration` state — add input and validation.

4. Ambient audio for focus sessions (item 12)
   - Reason: Adds immersion; reuse architecture from `CalmingSounds` but integrate `expo-av` for playback and loop control.

## Action log / Code references

- `app/(tabs)/focus.tsx` — Nothing Block, timer opacity, swipe-to-PIN, insights overlay, notifications silencing.
- `app/(tabs)/doodle.tsx` — Doodle UI, premium placeholders for Save/Export.
- `components/DrawingCanvas.tsx` — Stroke capture, exposes strokes for serialization.
- `app/(tabs)/schedule.tsx` — Scheduler UI; no notifications scheduling.
- `components/CalmingSounds.tsx` & `app/(tabs)/baby-lock.tsx` — Baby-mode sounds UI & gating; playback stubs.
- `components/ParentalDashboard.tsx` — Dashboard UI reading `babySessionHistory` from `AsyncStorage`.
- `hooks/useSubscription.ts` & `components/PremiumModal.tsx` — Subscription state and upsell flow.

If you'd like, I can now begin work on the highest-priority unresolved item: implement doodle save/export for premium users. I can (A) add export-to-SVG support and a Save flow that writes to file and optionally saves to the device photo library, (B) include unit tests for stroke serialization, and (C) wire the `Save` action in `doodle.tsx` to the new implementation. Which of these would you like me to start with?
