## Next Steps & Action Plan

Based on the audit, the highest-priority items are the remaining **Unresolved** features that are core to the user experience.

**Recommended Priority:**

1.  **Implement Custom Time Input for Nothing Block:** This is a minor but important feature for user flexibility.
2.  **Implement Doodle Saving for Premium Users:** This is a key premium feature that was promised.
3.  **Implement Nothing Scheduler Notifications:** The scheduler is incomplete without notifications.

I will now proceed with the highest-priority item: **Implement Custom Time Input for Nothing Block**.
